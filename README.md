## Technologies Used

- **Vite** - A fast frontend build tool for React applications.
- **React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router** - Used for client-side routing.
- **Context API** - Used for managing global state, specifically for authentication.
- **Leaflet** - A lightweight, open-source library for interactive maps.
- **Netlify** - Used for deployment.
- **ESLint** - For linting the codebase and ensuring consistent coding practices.

## Features

- **Fake Authentication**: Users can "log in" using hardcoded credentials. This demonstrates authentication without requiring an actual back-end server.
- **Geolocation and Maps**: Leaflet is integrated to display maps based on user location.
- **Routing**: Different pages of the application are accessible using React Router.
- **Pin Locations and Add Notes**: Users can pin locations on the map where theyâ€™ve visited, specify the city and date, and add notes about their visit.
